            26 April 2018
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
            <p>On Saturday morning, I woke up to find a number of spam-looking emails in my gmail
              account inbox...sent by me. Only, I hadn‚Äôt sent any of these.
            </p>
            <p>At first I thought that someone was sending me spam with the name of the sender
              simply set to the word ‚Äúme‚Äù, but knowing that Gmail does a pretty good job of filtering spam from
              unknown email addresses, I decided to investigate.</p>
            <p>Along the way, I discovered that this had happened to hundreds (if not more) of
              other people‚Äôs Gmail accounts.</p>
            <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*HY-22YjSf0Wy6dN6oYTPMA.png" class="img-responsive"
              alt="gmail hacking email hacked" />
            <br />
            <p></p>
            <b>Split Personality Spammer</b>
            <p></p>
            <p>Lo and behold, when I clicked on the sender to view more details, my email
              appeared
              as the sender. Even more concerning, these spam emails actually appeared in my Sent items folder
              as well, suggesting that I had indeed been sending them out from my email account.</p>
            <p>Unless I had some sort of split personality and one of my personas was getting up
              in the middle of the night to send myself spam emails (far-fetched, even for me), it seemed like
              my Gmail account had been hacked.</p>
            <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1150/1*Qj06FptE_8TyCbxqJ1OjIA.png" class="img-responsive"
              alt="gmail hacking email hacked" />
              <p></p>
              <p>Naturally, the first thing I did was check whether my Google account had any
              suspicious activity like someone logging in from a new device (it didn‚Äôt), but to be safe, I
              reset
              my password and logged myself out of all devices. I then marked the emails as spam (which
              worried
              me, because it could mean I wouldn‚Äôt actually receive any future emails I sent to myself), and
              went to bed.</p>
            <p class="text-center"> üí§ </p>
            <p>The next morning, I woke up and discovered the exact same thing had happened
              again.
              The emails that I was getting usually revolved around cryptocurrency scams, weight loss scams,
              and
              financial loan scams ‚Äî and all of them were from me.</p>
            <p>I took a look further into it and found that there were a bunch of fake email
              address recipients (things like my full name @salesforce.com, which I‚Äôm quite sure isn‚Äôt an
              actual
              email, plus other fake emails like norply@mxtoolbox.com), and that the sender was definitely my
              Gmail account‚Ä¶ <b>except that it had the words ‚Äúvia Telus‚Äù added to the end of the sender.</b>
              Further,
              under the security label of the email, Gmail warned that the email was not encrypted ‚Äî a message
              that does not usually appear in emails I send myself.</p>

            <b>Telus The Truth</b>
            <p></p>
            <p>When I went to the office on Monday, I asked our Head of Engineering if he had
              encountered the same thing. After showing him the email, he explained that what had happened
              was
              that my email had been spoofed ‚Äî not hacked ‚Äî thanks to a Canadian telecommunication company
              called Telus.
            </p>
            <p>Long story short, Telus appears to have allowed all IP addresses to send
              spoofed
              emails as though they were coming from its server. As a result, the hacker(s) were able to
              make
              emails appear to be sent from the Telus server, but internally in the email header, changed
              the
              sender to be my Gmail address. When the Gmail server was notified that an email was incoming
              to my
              inbox (with other recipients listed, likely to make the email look more authentic, even though
              the
              email addresses look quite blatantly fake), it queried Telus‚Äôs domain DNS server to check to
              see
              if the email server that sent the email was permitted to send messages on its behalf (which
              was
              answered in the affirmative because of Telus‚Äôs settings)‚Ä¶and then delivered them straight into
              my
              inbox. Click here for a more in-depth explanation.</p>
            <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*rOEUiC0WVplZkfRpttu5ig.png" class="img-responsive"
              alt="spoofed email message server gmail hack hacking" />
            <p></p>
            <p>Upon receiving an email that <i>appeared</i> to be sent by me, Gmail
              automatically
              filed a
              copy of it in my Sent items ‚Äî hence why they were appearing there as well.</p>
            <p>This ability to spoof Gmail servers was apparently previously raised with
              Google by
              a researcher last year ‚Äî but the company responded by saying that because it ‚Äúdid not
              substantially affect the confidentiality or integrity of Google users‚Äô data‚Äù, it would not be
              taking any action.</p>
            <p>However, this latest incident caused a furore online, with <b>hundreds of Gmail
                users
                posting on numerous threads about the issue </b> ‚Äî including those who already had high
              level
              security
              settings and two factor authentication implemented (which indicated that it was not a hacking
              issue).</p>
            <p>Initial reports indicated that Telus had denied any involvement in the issue
              and
              had said that it was a Google problem ‚Äî but this position was abandoned rather quickly, and by
              Monday evening, the problem had been fixed.</p>

            <p></p>
            <b>Stop The Spoof</b>
            <p></p>
            <p>In order to figure out whether an email that appears to be coming from a
              legitimate
              source (like your own Gmail account!) is a spoof email, always check the sender label for
              tell-tale signs like ‚Äúvia [xx]‚Äù and also check the security label to see if the email has
              been
              encrypted.</p>
            <p>If you want to be even more careful, open the email in Gmail, click the top
              right
              dropdown menu arrow, and select ‚ÄúShow original‚Äù. This will open up the message headers, and
              you
              can search for the Return-Path to see who is the actual sender of the email.</p>
            <p>As always, don‚Äôt click on anything inside the email itself ‚Äî in fact, I was
              quick
              to report these emails as spam and empty them out of my trash in Gmail. Finally, consider
              turning
              on two factor authentication (with a strong password), and monitor your account for
              suspicious
              activities.</p>
