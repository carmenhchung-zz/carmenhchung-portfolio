          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
            <p>One of the earliest projects I was involved in at Valiant was investigating ways
              to
              optimise performance and memory consumption in our Rails web application. Although I had heard
              the
              age-old complaints about Rails applications being slow, bulky and prone to memory bloat, I had
              yet
              to come across any practical, easy-to-navigate solutions to these issues.</p>
            <p>Until we discovered jemalloc.</p>
            <p>In this blog post, I will be giving a brief overview of what jemalloc is; how to
              check your current Rails app’s performance and memory consumption (including testing to see
              whether you have a memory leak); how to install jemalloc locally and in production; and finally,
              show you what our end-results were after we switched to jemalloc (spoiler alert: we managed to
              halve our memory consumption in production!).</p>
            <b>What is jemalloc?</b>
            <p></p>
            <p>Ruby traditionally uses the C language function malloc to dynamically allocate,
              release, and re-allocate memory when storing objects. Jemalloc is a malloc(3) implementation
              developed by Jason Evans (hence the “je” initials at the start of malloc), which appears to be
              more effective at allocating memory compared to other allocators due to its focus on
              fragmentation
              avoidance and scalable concurrency support.</p>
            <b>Step 1: Check your app’s memory consumption</b>
            <p></p>
            <p>In order to determine whether switching to jemalloc actually has any positive
              effects on your Rails app, you first need to know how much memory is being consumed and how
              quickly the website responds. To check this locally, I added the following gems to the Gemfile
              (and did a bundle install):
            </p>
            <blockquote>gem "memory_profiler"<br />
              gem "derailed_benchmarks"</blockquote>
            <p>Note: you can run tests with these gems in the development, testing or
              production
              environments. If you want to run them in development / testing environments, make sure you
              remove
              the dotenv-rails gem from these environments in the Gemfile.</p>
            <p>To determine the total memory used by each gem in the Gemfile, run:</p>
            <blockquote>bundle exec derailed bundle:mem</blockquote>
            <p>To only show files above a certain memory usage, add CUT_OFF=0.3 (or whatever
              figure you want as the cut off). Also note that because Ruby only requires files once, if the
              same
              file is required by several libraries, the cost is only associated with the first library to
              require the file (duplicate entries will list all the parents they belong to).</p>
            <p>For example, a short excerpt of our results looked like this:</p>
            <blockquote>TOP: 70.2617 MiB<br />

            <p>(Note: 1 Mebibyte (MiB) = approximately 1.05 Megabytes.)</p>
            <p>Additionally, in your production environment, you can see the number of
              allocated
              objects created (by location, as well as by gem) when dependencies are required by running:
            </p>
            <blockquote>bundle exec derailed bundle:objects</blockquote>
            <p>Below is a sample of the number of objects created by our gems:
            </p>
            <blockquote>348351 activesupport<br />
              66931 erubis<br />
              54842 json<br />
              23655 addressable<br />

              7186 actionpack<br />
              6370 sass</blockquote>
            <p>In order to check to see whether you have a memory leak in a production
              environment, you can run:</p>
            <blockquote>bundle exec derailed exec perf:mem_over_time</blockquote>
            <p>This command sends numerous requests to the app and profiles memory usage over
              time
              - if you have a true memory leak, the memory use will continue increasing; if you do not have
              a
              memory leak, usually you will see app memory use increasing until it hits a "plateau", then
              peters
              off.</p>
            <p>Remember that results vary (and seem to vary a bit when running say 2,000 tests
              compared to 20,000 tests). By running the tests a number of times, we discovered that on
              average,
              our app's plateau seemed to occur around the 1.7 MiB - 1.8 MiB mark. This seemed to roughly
              correspond with our Heroku logs, which showed a plateau around the 1.6 MiB mark.</p>
            <blockquote>💡PRO TIP: To set the number of tests you want to run rather than let it run
              forever,
              you can use:<br />
              &emsp;TEST_COUNT=20_000 bundle exec derailed exec perf:mem_over_time.</blockquote>
            <b>Step 2: Check your app’s performance and speed</b>
            <p></p>
            <p>To check the overall efficiency of your application, you can hit an endpoint
              in
              the
              application using benchmark-ips (that is, benchmarking a block of code’s iterations per
              second)
              with this command:</p>
            <blockquote>bundle exec derailed exec perf:ips</blockquote>
            <p>A higher value is better as it means more iterations of the code block per
              second.
              A few of our results are as follows:</p>
            <blockquote>Warming up --------------------------------------
              ips 1.000 i/100ms
              Calculating -------------------------------------
              ips 5.070 (± 0.0%) i/s - 26.000 in 5.141956s

              Warming up --------------------------------------
              ips 1.000 i/100ms
              Calculating -------------------------------------
              ips 5.162 (± 0.0%) i/s - 26.000 in 5.051505s

              ips 4.741 (± 0.0%) i/s - 24.000 in 5.125214s</blockquote>
            <b>Step 3: Install Jemalloc (locally and in production)</b>
            <p></p>
            <p>To install jemalloc locally, simply add this to the Gemfile and bundle
              install:
            </p>
            <blockquote>gem 'jemalloc'</blockquote>
            <p>Note: if you use rvm (and have already installed Ruby 2.4.1), run rvm
              reinstall
              2.4.1 -C —with-jemalloc to reinstall Ruby with jemalloc.
            </p>
            <p>To check that your version of Ruby uses jemalloc, run:</p>
            <blockquote>ruby -r rbconfig -e "puts RbConfig::CONFIG['LIBS']".</blockquote>
            <p>Your response should be something like:</p>
            <blockquote>-lpthread -ljemalloc -ldl -lobjc</blockquote>
            <p>(The -ljemalloc means jemalloc is loaded when starting Ruby.)</p>
            <p>But what about in production? There are a few ways to add jemalloc in
              Heroku, but
              we found that the easiest way was to just add the buildpack with this command:</p>
            <blockquote>heroku buildpacks:add --index 1
              https://github.com/mojodna/heroku-buildpack-jemalloc.git
              --app [your app name here]</blockquote>
            <p>To confirm that it has been installed, run heroku buildpacks --app [your
              app name
              here], and you should see the buildpack listed.</p>
            <p>Alternatively, you can add the buildpack in Settings → Buildpacks → Add
              buildpack
              in the Heroku dashboard.</p>
            <b>Step 4: Check results locally</b>
            <p></p>
            <p>Run the same commands as in Step 1 to check memory consumption and speed
              post-jemalloc. Our results showed a 8.6953 MiB (9.117 MB) — which is 12.38% — saving of
              memory
              over the entire app. For allocated objects by location, we saved 5,064 MiB (5,310 MB) of
              memory.
            </p>
            <b>Step 5: Check results in production</b>
            <p></p>
            <p>We used siege, an http load testing and benchmarking utility, to
              overload our
              review applications with requests (stay tuned for our upcoming post on how to do
              this!). Without
              jemalloc, we found that we were averaging around 2.5 transactions per second, with an
              average of
              around 160 failed transactions during a 20 minute timeframe. With jemalloc, we ended
              up with an
              average of 6.6 transactions per second, and only 1.5 failed transactions during a 20
              minute
              timeframe.</p>
            <p>Most impressively, our Heroku dashboard results showed remarkable,
              almost
              immediate
              improvements. Prior to jemalloc, our memory usage would hit around 2 GB before being
              automatically
              force-restarted. After jemalloc, our memory usage dropped down to the 1 GB mark,
              avoiding the
              force-restart entirely.</p>

              alt="jemalloc results memory consumption ruby on rails app" />
            <p>Similarly, our response times to requests showed rapid decline — prior
              to
              jemalloc,
              some requests were taking as long as 30 seconds. Afterwards, our response times
              dropped to
              around
              5–10 seconds.</p>

            <br />
            <p></p>
            <b>Conclusion</b>
            <p></p>
            <p>We had incredible, tangible performance and memory consumption
              benefits after
              implementing jemalloc; and while this may not be the silver bullet to combat Rails’s
              reputation
              in
              the industry for sub-optimal garbage collection, it certainly helped us optimise our
              platform.
