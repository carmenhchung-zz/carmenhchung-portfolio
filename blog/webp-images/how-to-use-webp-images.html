                    <p class="mb-20">Ever felt like your website takes forever to load?</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">The good news is that you're not alone. A <a
                        href="https://think.storage.googleapis.com/docs/mobile-page-speed-new-industry-benchmarks.pdf"
                        target="_blank">report</a>
                      published by Google found that 70%
                      of the pages they analysed took more than 10 seconds to load‚Ää-‚Ääfor just one page.</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">The bad news is‚Ä¶well, that's bad. That same report found that 53% of visitors will
                      leave a webpage on mobile if it takes longer than three seconds to load. That means that every
                      second your website fails to load, a potential customer or client is dropping off.</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">Fortunately, there is still some good news left: the WebP file format can compress
                      your images to a size even smaller than a JPG file, with almost no reduction in quality, making
                      your website load more than twice as fast. And best of all, with less than 0.1% of websites
                      optimising their images with WebP (more on why later), you can gain a real advantage over your
                      competitors.</p>
                    <p class="subheading">Back it up a second: what is¬†WebP?</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">WebP is an image format that provides lossless and lossy compression for images on
                      the Internet using predictive coding to encode an image. It was introduced in 2010, and is
                      currently being developed and supported by Google. But it's not just Google that is using WebP:
                      Pinterest, Facebook (on Android devices), and YouTube's thumbnails all use WebP images, as well as
                      other big players.</p>
                    <p class="mb-20"><a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/im-webp/all/all"
                        target="_blank">Google
                        claims</a> that a WebP lossless image is 26% smaller than its PNG equivalent,
                      and that a WebP lossy image is 25‚Äì34% smaller than its JPG equivalent (as of Feb. 2019).</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">Let's take WebP images for a test. When I ran my JPG image through the WebP
                      converter, I got the following results:</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">
                      <ul>
                        <li>JPG image (already compressed): 279 KB</li>
                        <li>WebP at 100% lossless: 451 KB <i>(yes, this is higher‚Ää-‚Äämore on why below!)</i></li>
                        <li>WebP at 80% lossy: 156 KB <i>(56% of the original size)</i></li>
                      </ul>
                    </p>
                    <img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*ncFM96KNeGVb7LN85oYTIQ.png"
                      class="img-responsive" alt="WebP images compared to jpg and png lossless and lossy compression" />
                    <p class="caption">Left: Original jpg at 279 KB. Middle: 100% lossless WebP at 451 KB. Right: 80%
                      lossy WebP at 156 KB.</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">So you're probably wondering why the lossless WebP image is actually bigger than
                      the original JPG. This is because my original image was actually a lossless PNG file, which I then
                      converted and ran through an image compressor to produce a smaller JPG file. During this
                      compression process, the converter adds what is known as artifacts.</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">When you reverse the process and try to convert the lossy JPG back to a lossless
                      file format (like WebP), the algorithm will strip out unnecessary metadata (good)‚Ää-‚Ääbut it will
                      also encode each artifact it finds to reproduce it pixel-perfect (bad), often resulting in a file
                      size increase, but no visual benefits. As a result, the final file will end up even larger than if
                      you had converted it directly from the original PNG file!</p>
                    <blockquote>üí°<b>PRO TIP:</b> if your original image is a lossless file format (like PNG, BMP,
                      or
                      Raw),
                      convert it straight to a WebP image. Do not convert it to a lossy file format (like JPG or GIF)
                      first.</blockquote>
                    <p class="mb-20">Lossy compression (the one on the right above) creates images that are
                      approximately the same as the original: but because of the compression, the size is smaller (and
                      quality sometimes suffers‚Ää-‚Ääalthough in this case, it's barely noticeable). In addition, lossy
                      images lose their quality irreversibly‚Ää-‚Ääyou can't go back once you've converted it to a lossy
                      format, which means that if you compress the same lossy image over and over, each time, the
                      quality deteriorates.</p>
                    <blockquote>‚Äç‚Äçüí°<b>PRO TIP:</b> if you compress to lossy formats, you should always compress
                      the
                      original
                      image.
                      Don't compress already compressed files over and over, or you will compound the quality
                      deterioration.</blockquote>
                    <p class="subheading">I'm not convinced. Show me the¬†results.</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">I placed the three images above on standalone test pages, and put all three pages
                      simultaneously under siege (a benchmark utility testing tool I'll talk about more in another
                      post), hitting my test pages with around 25 simultaneous users to see how quickly their response
                      times would be.</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">Unsurprisingly, the 80% lossy WebP file (i.e. the smallest one) was the fastest,
                      clocking in with an average response time of 5.33 seconds to fully load; the JPG then took an
                      average of 8.34 seconds; and the 100% lossless WebP file took an average of 12.28 seconds.</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">So the 80% lossy WebP file was <b>2.3 times faster than the 100% lossless WebP
                        file,
                        and 1.56 times faster than the JPG.</b></p>
                    <p class="mb-20">For websites that are even more image heavy (such as photography websites, blogs or
                      visual portfolios), I would expect that the speed load difference would be even greater.</p>
                    <p class="subheading">Why isn't everyone using the WebP file format for their images¬†then?</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">As of February 2019, <a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=webp"
                        target="_blank">browser
                        support</a>
                      for WebP files is close to 72%, with Chrome,
                      Firefox, Opera and the latest Edge version supporting it. Unfortunately, Safari and IE don't (yet)
                      support WebP files, so you still need to have a fallback for those browsers‚Ää-‚Äämore on that below.
                    </p>
                    <p class="subheading">Okay, I'm interested. How do I implement WebP?</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">First, you'll need to convert your images to a WebP format. There are a few ways
                      you can do this, including easy-to-use converters like <a
                        href="https://image.online-convert.com/convert-to-webp" target="_blank">this one</a>
                      or <a href="https://convertio.co/jpg-webp" target="_blank">this one</a>. For those who use
                      Photoshop, you can also convert your image using a <a
                        href="http://www.bytesin.com/open-save-webp-image-files-photoshop/" target="_blank">WebP
                        plugin</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-20">Alternatively, you can download Google‚Äôs WebP converter <a
                        href="https://storage.googleapis.com/downloads.webmproject.org/releases/webp/index.html"
                        target="_blank">here</a>,
                      which converts JPGs
                      and PNGs to WebP, and WebP files to PNG or PPM. I prefer this option, because I trust the quality
                      of Google‚Äôs software conversion more, and I can specify precise options with each conversion.</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">For example, to convert a PNG file to 80% lossy WebP, you can the following command
                      in Terminal/Command Line.</p>
                    <blockquote>runcwebp -q 80
                      mypicture.png -o mypicture.webp </blockquote>
                    <p class="mb-20"></p>Straight forward instructions on how to
                    convert using this option can be found <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/cwebp"
                      target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">Don‚Äôt forget that once you‚Äôve converted your image, to keep your original JPG or
                      PNG file, because you‚Äôll need that as a fallback file in case the user‚Äôs browser does not support
                      WebP.</p>
                    <p class="subheading">I have my WebP images. Now what?</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">Let‚Äôs just assume that you want to show your image in the normal HTML way (rather
                      than inside a CSS class, which I‚Äôll discuss later). To do this, use the following code (obviously
                      replace references to "mypicture" with the name of your image file):</p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p class="coding-language">(HTML)</p><br />
                      &lt;picture&gt;<br />
                      &emsp;&lt;source srcset="images/mypicture.webp" type="image/webp"&gt;<br />
                      &emsp;&lt;source srcset="images/mypicture.jpg" type="image/jpeg"&gt;<br />
                      &emsp;&lt;img alt="This is my face" src="images/mypicture.jpg"&gt;<br />
                      &lt;/picture&gt;
                    </blockquote>
                    <p class="mb-20">What is happening here is that we‚Äôre first checking to see if the browser supports
                      the &lt;picture&gt; tag. If it does, we‚Äôll serve up the WebP image; if it doesn‚Äôt, we will serve
                      up
                      the
                      JPG image. If the browser doesn‚Äôt even support the &lt;picture&gt; tag, then we‚Äôll have a final
                      fallback of the normal &lt;img&gt; tag.</p>
                    <p class="subheading">Great. But what if I have an image inside a CSS class, like a background image
                      url?</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">This requires a bit more work.</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">First, you‚Äôll need to know when a user‚Äôs browser can‚Äôt handle your WebP files, so
                      that you can load the back up JPG or PNG files (which will be in another CSS class) instead.</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">In order to do this, I use Modernizr to help me detect what sort of browser the
                      user is using (and therefore what features their browser supports). You can go to <a
                        href="https://modernizr.com/download?webp-setclasses" target="_blank">their website</a>,
                      click on ‚ÄúWebP‚Äù and then click on ‚ÄúBuild‚Äù.</p>
                    <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*8gzNQZlgOG428hwdTnU2sg.png" target="_blank"
                      class="img-responsive" alt="Use Modernizr to detect WebP images" />
                    <p class="mb-20">A popup will then appear ‚Äî hit ‚ÄúDownload‚Äù next to the Build command.</p>
                    <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*TcF9wsQL3tpleXG9Kw_Tlw.png" target="_blank"
                      class="img-responsive" alt="Use Modernizr to detect WebP images" />
                    <p class="mb-20">After that, a file named "modernizr-custom.js" will be downloaded ‚Äî move that file
                      into your website directory (let‚Äôs say your root folder). In order to call and trigger Modernizr,
                      put this at the bottom of the HTML page where you are displaying your WebP files:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p class="coding-language">(HTML)</p>
                      <p>
                        <i>// First, refer to the location of your downloaded Modernizr script. I have just left mine in
                          the
                          root folder.</i>
                      </p>
                      &lt;script src="modernizr-custom.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
                      <p>
                        <i>// Second, trigger Modernizr to detect WebP compatibility. <br />
                        </i>
                      </p>
                      &lt;script&gt;
                      <br />
                      &emsp;Modernizr.on('webp', function (result) {
                      <br />
                      &emsp;&emsp;if (result) {
                      <br />
                      &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;// supported

                    <p class="mb-20">Modernizr will now automatically apply either a webp or no-webp class to the HTML
                      element (in my example, the container holding the image), depending on whether it detects browser
                      support for WebP or not. That means you can specify which images you want within your CSS class,
                      by targeting either of those classes like this:</p>

                    <p class="subheading">What happens if the user doesn‚Äôt have Javascript enabled?</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">Ugh! Why would they do that? (I‚Äôm looking at you, Internet Explorer!)</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">Modernizr does rely on Javascript being enabled on your user‚Äôs browser, so to get
                      around this, you will need to add an HTML class at the top of the page, say &lt;html
                      class=‚Äùno-js‚Äù&gt;.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-20">Then, add Javascript code that will successfully remove this class if Javascript is
                      enabled:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p class="coding-language">(HTML)</p><br />
                      &lt;script&gt;<br />
                      &emsp;document.documentElement.classList.remove("no-js");<br />
                      &lt;/script&gt;
                    </blockquote>
                    <p class="mb-20">If Javascript is not enabled, then the class will automatically be applied to all
                      the HTML elements on your page ‚Äî and you can create a no-js class with the JPG image as the
                      background image:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p class="coding-language">(CSS)</p><br />
                      .no-js .container {</br>
                      &emsp;background-image: url("mypicture.jpg");<br />

                    <p class="subheading">Conclusion</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">WebP images are relatively easy to implement when you are simply displaying images
                      in your HTML code (you won‚Äôt need Modernizr or the "no-js" class), but become slightly more
                      time-consuming when you use images within your CSS (say, as background images).</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">Keep in mind that how long your website takes to load has a direct impact on the
                      amount of time your visitors will spend on your site‚Äî and therefore, affect your lead conversion
                      rate‚Äî so the time you spend in making the switch to WebP images is worth it, for the extra time
                      your users will stay on your website.</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">If you implement WebP images, please <a href="https://twitter.com/carmenhchung"
