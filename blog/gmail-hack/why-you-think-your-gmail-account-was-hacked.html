                    <p class="mb-20">On Saturday morning, I woke up to find a number of spam-looking emails in my gmail
                      account inbox‚Ä¶sent by me. Only, I hadn‚Äôt sent any of these.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-20">At first I thought that someone was sending me spam with the name of the sender
                      simply set to the word ‚Äúme‚Äù, but knowing that Gmail does a pretty good job of filtering spam from
                      unknown email addresses, I decided to investigate.</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">Along the way, I discovered that this had happened to hundreds (if not more) of
                      other people‚Äôs Gmail accounts.</p>
                    <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*HY-22YjSf0Wy6dN6oYTPMA.png" class="img-responsive"

                    <p class="subheading">Split Personality Spammer</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">Lo and behold, when I clicked on the sender to view more details, my email
                      appeared
                      as the sender. Even more concerning, these spam emails actually appeared in my Sent items folder
                      as well, suggesting that I had indeed been sending them out from my email account.</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">Unless I had some sort of split personality and one of my personas was getting up
                      in the middle of the night to send myself spam emails (far-fetched, even for me), it seemed like
                      my Gmail account had been hacked.</p>
                    <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1150/1*Qj06FptE_8TyCbxqJ1OjIA.png" class="img-responsive"
                      alt="gmail hacking email hacked" />
                    <p class="mb-20">Naturally, the first thing I did was check whether my Google account had any
                      suspicious activity like someone logging in from a new device (it didn‚Äôt), but to be safe, I
                      reset
                      my password and logged myself out of all devices. I then marked the emails as spam (which
                      worried
                      me, because it could mean I wouldn‚Äôt actually receive any future emails I sent to myself), and
                      went to bed.</p>
                    <p class="mb-20 text-center"> üí§ </p>
                    <p class="mb-20">The next morning, I woke up and discovered the exact same thing had happened
                      again.
                      The emails that I was getting usually revolved around cryptocurrency scams, weight loss scams,
                      and
                      financial loan scams ‚Äî and all of them were from me.</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">I took a look further into it and found that there were a bunch of fake email
                      address recipients (things like my full name @salesforce.com, which I‚Äôm quite sure isn‚Äôt an
                      actual
                      email, plus other fake emails like norply@mxtoolbox.com), and that the sender was definitely my
                      Gmail account‚Ä¶ <b>except that it had the words ‚Äúvia Telus‚Äù added to the end of the sender.</b>
                      Further,
                      under the security label of the email, Gmail warned that the email was not encrypted ‚Äî a message
                      that does not usually appear in emails I send myself.</p>

                    <p class="subheading">Telus The Truth</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">When I went to the office on Monday, I asked our Head of Engineering if he had
                      encountered the same thing. After showing him the email, he explained that what had happened
                      was
                      that my email had been spoofed ‚Äî not hacked ‚Äî thanks to a Canadian telecommunication company
                      called Telus.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-20">Long story short, Telus appears to have allowed all IP addresses to send
                      spoofed
                      emails as though they were coming from its server. As a result, the hacker(s) were able to
                      make
                      emails appear to be sent from the Telus server, but internally in the email header, changed
                      the
                      sender to be my Gmail address. When the Gmail server was notified that an email was incoming
                      to my
                      inbox (with other recipients listed, likely to make the email look more authentic, even though
                      the
                      email addresses look quite blatantly fake), it queried Telus‚Äôs domain DNS server to check to
                      see
                      if the email server that sent the email was permitted to send messages on its behalf (which
                      was
                      answered in the affirmative because of Telus‚Äôs settings)‚Ä¶and then delivered them straight into
                      my
                      inbox. Click here for a more in-depth explanation.</p>
                    <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*rOEUiC0WVplZkfRpttu5ig.png" class="img-responsive"
                      alt="spoofed email message server gmail hack hacking" />
                    <p class="mb-20">Upon receiving an email that <i>appeared</i> to be sent by me, Gmail
                      automatically
                      filed a
                      copy of it in my Sent items ‚Äî hence why they were appearing there as well.</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">This ability to spoof Gmail servers was apparently previously raised with
                      Google by
                      a researcher last year ‚Äî but the company responded by saying that because it ‚Äúdid not
                      substantially affect the confidentiality or integrity of Google users‚Äô data‚Äù, it would not be
                      taking any action.</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">However, this latest incident caused a furore online, with <b>hundreds of Gmail
                        users
                        posting on numerous threads about the issue </b> ‚Äî including those who already had high
                      level
                      security
                      settings and two factor authentication implemented (which indicated that it was not a hacking
                      issue).</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">Initial reports indicated that Telus had denied any involvement in the issue
                      and
                      had said that it was a Google problem ‚Äî but this position was abandoned rather quickly, and by
                      Monday evening, the problem had been fixed.</p>

                    <p class="subheading">Stop The Spoof</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">In order to figure out whether an email that appears to be coming from a
                      legitimate
                      source (like your own Gmail account!) is a spoof email, always check the sender label for
                      tell-tale signs like ‚Äúvia [xx]‚Äù and also check the security label to see if the email has
                      been
                      encrypted.</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">If you want to be even more careful, open the email in Gmail, click the top
                      right
                      dropdown menu arrow, and select ‚ÄúShow original‚Äù. This will open up the message headers, and
                      you
                      can search for the Return-Path to see who is the actual sender of the email.</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">As always, don‚Äôt click on anything inside the email itself ‚Äî in fact, I was
                      quick
                      to report these emails as spam and empty them out of my trash in Gmail. Finally, consider
                      turning
                      on two factor authentication (with a strong password), and monitor your account for
                      suspicious
                      activities.</p>
