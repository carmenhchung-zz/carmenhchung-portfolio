                    <p class="mb-20">As part of my coding bootcamp at <a href="https://coderacademy.edu.au/"
                        target="_blank">Coder
                        Academy</a>, I was placed as a software
                      engineering intern at <a href="https://valiant.finance/" target="_blank">Valiant Finance</a>,
                      winner of the Australian Fintech Start Up
                      of the Year
                      (2017) Award. In the four weeks I have been here, I have made more intellectual discoveries than I
                      can count: all thanks to the incredible mentorship and patience of the team I have been working
                      with.</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">Here are the top 10 things I learned during my internship, divided into technical
                      and non-technical lessons.</p>
                    <h2>TECHNICAL</h2>
                    <p class="subheading">Be meticulous</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">Having been a corporate lawyer for seven years, I have always prided myself on
                      attention to detail. But mistakes do happen.</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">In the third week of my internship, I hit Ctrl + F to find a word I was searching
                      for in my file. Then I must have accidentally hit the space bar, deleting the word entirely.</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">To my mortification, I didn't notice that I had done this . It was something that
                      would not have thrown an obvious error - otherwise our tests would have picked it up. Rather, it
                      would have gone unnoticed and "failed silently"…if it hadn't been for the sharp eyes of our
                      Co-Founder, Ritchie.</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">To avoid making my mistake, check out GitHub Desktop. It displays all the changes
                      you've made to a file, and allows you to comb through line-by-line, one final time before
                      committing. It's easy to skip through this part. But taking the time to review your changes one
                      last time <b>before you commit / push</b> can save you serious heart-ache - and embarrassment - at
                      a
                      later stage.</p>
                    <img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*zm_4bXcb6xSpfDFrinBrRw.jpeg"
                      class="img-responsive" alt="When you git blame and it's you">
                    <p class="mb-20">I can't stress enough how important <b>attention to detail</b> is. One missing
                      semi-colon
                      in some languages can stop your code dead in its tracks. Other things are less insidious, but
                      still annoying.</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">Even simple things like checking your company's Git commits to see how they write
                      them - for example, we use a specified emoticon to indicate what the commit is, capitalise the
                      first word in the commit, use present tense, and don't add punctuation to the end - saves you from
                      irritating your colleagues when you stray from the path of consistency.</p>
                    <p class="subheading">Take notes (and study hard)</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">Forget the Fountain of Knowledge.</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">Almost every day that I've been at Valiant Finance, I've felt like I'm drinking
                      from a fire hose. The amount of sheer knowledge and wisdom that comes spouting out from the mouths
                      of our Head of Engineering (Kris Hofer) and our Co-Founder (Ritchie Cotton) is enough to make
                      anyone's head swim. Much to my relief, these two guys are very well-structured and patient in the
                      way they teach, so everything clicks neatly into place.</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">They click faster, though, if you take notes.</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">I have an organized notebook with headings and a Table of Contents page to help me
                      keep track of everything I've learned. Bits of code that I use repeatedly are highlighted, and I
                      have brass tabs for sections that I use frequently.</p>

                      class="img-responsive" alt="Writing effective notes for software engineers" />
                    <p class="mb-20">On top of this, I have a Weekly Planner where I jot down all the tasks that we need
                      to tackle every day, and a non-lined notebook for drawing out flowcharts - for more complicated
                      programming logic - and wireframes.</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">Most importantly, I write a list of all the things that Ritchie and Kris mention
                      that I know I will need to do more research into on my own time.</p>
                    <img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*OqRc7yjubxwZWonWS3wvLA.png"

                    <p class="subheading">Don't reinvent the wheel</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">One of the things I discovered was that Ritchie had set up an incredible CSS
                      system, with his own fully-customized stylesheets (using the <a
                        href="http://getbem.com/introduction/" target="_blank">BEM method</a>) - and a style guide that
                      would make any documentation-aficionado's heart sing.</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">Before I became familiar with the system, I was tempted to create certain CSS
                      classes that I figured would be easy for me to access and apply. What I came to realize and
                      respect was that there was basically no need for me to do so. In almost every case there was
                      already a set of clear and flexible styles that I could switch in and out - like interchangeable
                      Lego pieces - all at my fingertips. By creating unnecessary styling classes, I would be cluttering
                      up a structured and clean system, making it harder for people to navigate at a later stage.</p>

                    <p class="caption">If you have great Lego blocks, don't remake them. Focus instead on making
                      things with them.</p>
                    <p class="subheading">Avoid verbosity</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">One of the key principles of Ruby on Rails is DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). It's
                      something that has been drilled into junior Rails developers from day one…but oh, how the struggle
                      is real.</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">My fellow intern and I were tasked with creating code that would count the number
                      of people a user had referred to the platform. For every three referrals, the user would receive
                      $50. The logic was manageable, but what we discovered was that we had to account for one friend
                      vs. many friends when displaying the result.</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">This was how our code initially came out:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                      - if @invite_count == 1<br />
                      &emsp;%p<br />
                      &emsp;You have invited 1 friend to be part of Valiant Finance.<br />
                      - if @invite_count > 1<br />
                      &emsp;%p<br />
                      &emsp;You have invited %strong #{@invite_count} friends to be part of Valiant Finance!<br />
                      - if (@invite_count % 3) == 0 || (@invite_count % 3) == 1<br />
                      &emsp;%p<br />
                      &emsp;Invite another %strong #{3 - (@invite_count % 3)} friends to receive $50!<br />
                      - if (@invite_count % 3) == 2<br />
                      &emsp;%p<br />
                      &emsp;Invite another %strong friend to receive $50!
                    </blockquote>
                    <p class="mb-20">When I showed Ritchie, he told us to look into <a

                        target="_blank">pluralize</a>.</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">Mind. Blown.</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">This was how our code came out afterwards:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                      %p<br />
                      You have invited #{@invite_count} #{"friend".pluralize(@invite_count)} to be part of Valiant
                      Finance.<br />
                      %p<br />
                      Invite another<br />
                      %strong #{3 - (@invite_count % 3)} #{"friend".pluralize(3 - (@invite_count % 3))}
                      to receive $50!<br />

                    <p class="mb-20">A number of junior web developers use certain terms interchangeably without being
                      aware that there are - sometimes minute, sometimes not so minute! - differences between them. I'm
                      guilty of frequently Googling the differences between .present?, .exists?, and .any?;
                      and .empty?, .nil?, and .blank?. Made all the more cringe-worthy because .exists? has actually

                    <p class="caption">Looks like I'm not the only one who forgets this.</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">Sometimes the intricacies are almost unnoticeable - in the first week of my
                      internship, I was typing Product.all.map(&:name). But I was later taught that I could instead just
                      use Product.pluck(:name). There is a difference between the two in terms of efficiency - both with
                      respect to me actually typing it out, and in terms of search speed. For more info, take a look at
                      <a href="https://rubyinrails.com/2014/06/05/rails-pluck-vs-select-map-collect/"

                    <h2>NON-TECHNICAL</h2>
                    <p class="subheading">Get involved in the company</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">Sounds simple, right? But when you're juggling a lot of tasks and trying to get
                      yourself oriented at a new company, it's easy to forget the little things that matter to the
                      people around you.</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">On our first day at the company, the other intern and I were encouraged to sign up
                      for Twitter. On the train to work the next morning, I dutifully set up an account, and followed
                      our company's account, plus the accounts of a few colleagues.</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">Given that I already have multiple social media accounts, I was initially reluctant
                      to add another to the mix. But it has turned out to be really beneficial.</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">I've been able to keep up-to-date on the company's news plus the news of key
                      partners, as well as check out interesting tweets from my colleagues. I have been tweeting posts
                      about company events and new product features that our team has been working on. It's an easy way
                      to get involved, and shows that you actually care about where you work.</p>

                    <p class="subheading">Ask questions - but more importantly, listen</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">Kris, our Head of Engineering, very kindly told us that "there are no stupid
                      questions," and that we are encouraged to ask whatever comes to mind.</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">I, on the other hand, firmly believe there is such thing as a stupid question.
                      Usually those occur when you just haven't been paying attention, or when you're too lazy to think
                      for yourself about what has been said. Asking questions is important, particularly when you
                      genuinely don't understand something. But listening to answers is even more so.</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">Take the time to listen to what is being said, and think about it. It's human
                      nature to hear the words coming out of someone else's mouth, and start mentally preparing a
                      response while they're talking. Don't do it. <b>Pay attention to what you're being told.</b></p>

                    <p class="subheading">Know whom to talk to</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">One of the great things about this internship was that we were encouraged to reach
                      out to members of other teams to discuss what product features they wanted, and how we could
                      implement them. We learned to defer to their expertise in some respects, and to the judgement of
                      our Product team in others.</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">For example, we were tasked with building the tabs on the broker dashboard so that
                      the leads that have been submitted by a broker are neatly divided into Active, Inactive, and
                      Settled. In addition, we created a referral link card - as mentioned earlier.</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">Both of these tasks required liaising with the Head of Third Party Partnerships so
                      that the functionality and language of the feature was suitable for the broker audience.</p>

                      class="img-responsive" alt="Valiant Finance broker partner dashboard" />
                    <p heading="caption">We worked with the Head of Third Party Partnerships to produce the responsive
                      dashboard tabs, and Refer a Broker feature</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">Having said that, there were times where we were trying to build something that
                      attracted a great deal of interest from a number of people in the company - resulting in
                      (sometimes conflicting) input. At times like these, we would defer to our Product team leaders,
                      who would give us guidance - and equally importantly - step in as a buffer if the noise from other
                      teams got too loud.</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">Don't be afraid to ask your supervisors for assistance in these cases - they are
                      usually better equipped and more experienced to tell other teams that what they are asking for is
                      u̶t̶t̶e̶r̶l̶y̶ ̶r̶i̶d̶i̶c̶u̶l̶o̶u̶s̶ going to take a while longer than expected to implement and
                      that because it is u̶t̶t̶e̶r̶l̶y̶ ̶r̶i̶d̶i̶c̶u̶l̶o̶u̶s̶ not business critical, it will be added to
                      the u̶t̶t̶e̶r̶l̶y̶ ̶r̶i̶d̶i̶c̶u̶l̶o̶u̶s̶ ̶l̶i̶s̶t̶ developer log list of things to do.</p>
                    <p class="subheading">Stay humble</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">Because there are so many ways to skin a cat in the dev world, it's easy to get
                      caught up in a particular way of doing things, and assume that your way is better than everyone
                      else's way.</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">Don't get me wrong - there are best practices, and there are, no doubt, good rules
                      that each company follows in order to ensure code consistency. But don't dismiss what others have
                      done just because it doesn't conform to what you're used to. It may (or may not) be even better
                      than your code.</p>

                    <p class="mb-20">On that note: when you have messed up, know that it's time to eat some humble pie.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-20">Own up to it, apologize, learn from the mistake, and try not to let it eat at you.
                      The last part is the hardest for me. I had nightmares for a week after the deletion mistake
                      mentioned in the beginning.</p>
                    <p class="subheading">Have fun</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">At Valiant Finance, we celebrate wins. We have an entire Slack channel dedicated to
                      cheering each other on in both our professional and personal endeavours.</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">We do team building activities, we have soft toys and dogs in the office, and we do
                      casual Friday night drinks.</p>

                    <p class="mb-20">It seems obvious, but people want to work around happy people. While you're not
                      there to make drinking buddies at your internship company (bonus points if you do though!), you
                      want to enjoy your time there - and the company should want you to as well. The whole point of the
                      internship is to try to see if you are a good fit for the company - and vice versa.</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">Try to enjoy yourself during the internship - but if what you're working on is
                      tedious and mundane, try to make a game out of it. I'm a seasoned connoisseur at making boring
                      work seem fun - perhaps something I'll dive into further in another post.</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">If you're unhappy as an intern, chances are, you'll be unhappy as a full-time
                      employee.</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">And no one wants that.</p>
                    <p class="mb-20">Big shout out goes to Co-Founder Ritchie Cotton, and Head of Engineering Kris
                      Hofer,
                      and for their incredible patience, mentorship and knowledge throughout my internship at Valiant
                      Finance. I never imagined learning so much in such a short period of time - or having so much fun
                      doing it. Thank you guys.</p>
